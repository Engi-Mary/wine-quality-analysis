🍷 Wine Quality Analysis – Data Science Project

This project explores what makes a red wine “high quality” based on its chemical properties.
The analysis was created for a food retail company interested in improving its product selection.

All work is contained in one exploratory notebook and a short slide deck.

🔍 Key Findings

Higher alcohol content → higher quality

Sulfates also contribute positively

Volatile acidity has a negative effect

Only ~12% of wines in the dataset are high quality

Random Forest model achieved 89% accuracy, with lower recall for the minority class (high-quality wines)

These patterns are clearly visible in the visualizations in the notebook.
