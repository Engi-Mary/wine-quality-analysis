# Wine Quality Analysis – Data Science Project

This project explores what makes a red wine “high quality” based on its physicochemical properties.
It is a hands-on data science project focusing on:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation & Feature Importance
- Machine Learning Classification (Random Forest)
- Storytelling-driven communication of insights

## 🎯 Goal

Identify the key drivers of wine quality (quality ≥ 7) and demonstrate a clear, communicative analysis workflow.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **notebooks/** – Jupyter Notebooks for EDA, modeling, and evaluation
- **src/** – Python modules for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- **reports/** – Figures and slides used in the final presentation
- **data/** – (Dataset link, not included due to license)

## 📊 Key Insights

- Alcohol is the strongest predictor of wine quality  
- Sulfates have a positive impact  
- Volatile acidity correlates negatively  
- The dataset is imbalanced (only ~12% high-quality wines)

## 🤖 Model

Model: Random Forest Classifier  
Accuracy: 89%  
Challenge: low recall on minority class (high-quality wines)

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Try oversampling (SMOTE)
- Experiment with gradient boosting models
- Add a lightweight API prototype (future learning goal)

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m Maryam, a mid-level data scientist with a background in AI & computer science.
My goal is to bridge the gap between data science and public understanding through clear, engaging storytelling.
