🍷 Wine Quality Analysis – Data Science Project

This project explores what makes a red wine “high quality” based on its chemical properties.
The analysis was created for a food retail company interested in improving its product selection.

All work is contained in a single exploratory notebook and a short slide deck.

🔍 Key Findings

Higher alcohol content → higher quality

Sulfates contribute positively to quality

Volatile acidity has a clear negative effect

Only ~12% of wines in the dataset are high quality

A Random Forest model reached 89% accuracy, with lower recall for the rare high-quality wines (class imbalance)

These patterns are clearly visible in the visualizations inside the notebook.

📊 Repository Contents
