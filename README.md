# Wine Quality Analysis – Data Science Project

This project explores what makes a red wine “high quality” based on its physicochemical properties.
It is a hands-on data science project focusing on:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Correlation & Feature Importance
- Machine Learning Classification (Random Forest)
- Storytelling-driven communication of insights

## 🎯 Goal

Identify the key drivers of wine quality (quality ≥ 7) and demonstrate a clear, communicative analysis workflow.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **notebooks/** – Jupyter Notebooks for EDA, modeling, and evaluation
- **src/** – Python modules for preprocessing, training, and evaluation
- **reports/** – Figures and slides used in the final presentation
- **data/** – winequality-red.csv  → https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality

## 📊 Key Insights

- Alcohol is the strongest predictor of wine quality  
- Sulfates have a positive impact  
- Volatile acidity correlates negatively  
- The dataset is imbalanced (only ~12% high-quality wines)

## 🤖 Model

Model: Random Forest Classifier  
Accuracy: 89%  
Challenge: low recall on minority class (high-quality wines)

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Try oversampling (SMOTE)
- Experiment with gradient boosting models
- Add a lightweight API prototype (future learning goal)


## 👩‍💻 About Me
I'm Maryam. I studied my bachelor in computer engineering with software specialization and my masters in computer science with AI and data science specialization. I'd like to work on practical topics and use my know-how and skills in data science and storytelling to fill the gap between science and society.
